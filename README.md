# Soundcloud Like Parser

A simple Python script that scrapes the public Soundcloud api to calculate the artists and genres you've liked the most. 
It uses the public api methods, therefore you'll need a client_id and a user_id. Both can be retrieved with any browser's developer tools by capturing the API calls with the filter "track_likes?"

# Soundcloud Like Parser

A simple Python script that scrapes the public Soundcloud api to calculate the artists and genres you've liked the most. 
It uses the public api methods, therefore you'll need a `client_id` and a `user_id`. Both can be retrieved with any browser's developer tools by capturing the API calls with the filter `track_likes?`
